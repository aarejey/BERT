## NER in spaCY
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key component of NLP and Spacy provides a simple and efficient implementation of this task. With Spacy's NER, you can extract entities such as people, organizations, and locations from unstructured text with high accuracy. Spacy's pre-trained models can be used out-of-the-box for NER in multiple languages, or you can fine-tune them with your own annotated data. NER is a crucial step in many NLP pipelines and Spacy's efficient NER implementation makes it a valuable tool for any NLP project...
